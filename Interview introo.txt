Introduction
============
	This is sandosh kumar, from cuddalore  i have done my graduate in BE civil engineering @kongu engineering college in erode 
        currently I am working in Inter webstar technology for 3.3 years in both automation and manual on diffrent domains such as E-Commerce & travel.
	In My travel domain which is kenya Based client. In that i got involved to write Test cases and executing test data manually.
	My current project is E- commerce  domain which is austraila based client .In that we follow Agile methodology with 3weeks of sprint. 
	we implements BDD framework with cucumber tool.
	And In that we used maven dependency as a  management tool.
	We use design patterns such as pom frame work and Data Driven framework.
	we use JIRA as defect tracking tool. 
	Apart from this I have experience on other framework such as TestnG which is used to excute parallel an cross Browser experience.
    
Roles and responsibilities:
=============================
	In our project, we used agile methodologies. In that, first we attend the sprint plan meetings. 
	In that, we grab some user stories from product backlog into sprint backlog to be completed in the sprint.
	Also we discussed about the user stories and then we set the story points by using poker card techniques. 
	If I had any queries in that user stories means, I just make a walkthrough session with my BA. He will clarify my queries. 
	(Also if we want to implement any new technology in our project means I will attend the workshop with SME's and gain the knowledge about those technologies. 
	Then, I will get an application access.)

	Also, I will be a part of helping my manager to prepare a test strategy and test schedule document. 
	
Once I clarify the doubt, I start to prepare my test cases.
Once I complete the test cases, i want to get approvel from BA. 
If BA reviewed and told me any changes i will rework the test cases until it get approved. In between this, 
I attend the daily stand up call meeting for reporting what I  completed yesterday, what to be completed today and Whether Iâ€™m blocked with anything.(user stories or tasks)
Once I get a build from dev team, first i do a smoke test to check whether the build will testable or not. If it is testable means, 
i will execute the test cases along with test data to those build. If there is any deviation from the user stories means I will raise it as a bug through JIRA.
After the bug fixed by the developer, I will retest the test cases to check whether the bugs is fixed or not. 
At every weekend, I do a regression testing through JENKINS and generate a report. At the end of the every sprint, sprint review will be conducted. 
In that we will show a demo of the completed user stories in front of our product owner, scrum master, my team and other business people. 
After that sprint retrospective meeting will be conducted. In this meeting we talk about positive and negatives of the completed user stories.
	
Before deployment, we give some sign off based on the test case execution. 

	1. There is no issue in the product means we give it as positive sign off.
	2. Due to time constraint, only sanity test will be done means we give it as Conditional sign off.
	3. The issue is high, but the client wants the product means we give it as Risk based sign off. 


Cucumber workflow:
===================
	Execution starts from pom.xml, where I have used maven as my project management tool. 
	In our project, we used cucumber with junit. 
	In our testrunner class, we have used two annotations like @RunWith and @CucumberOptions. 
sIn @RunWith annotation I will pass the Cucumber.class as the arguments. In @CucumberOptions, I gave used the options as 
1.features ---> where I will give the path of my feature file
2.glue ---> where I will pass the step definition package.
3.dryRun ---> used to generating the missing snippets before the execution itself.
4.plugin ---> pass the path of the folder where I want to generate and store the report.
	In plugin, I will give either pretty or usage.
If I give pretty means, in my console it will print the way like what are the scenarios have been executed and scenarios have been skipped.
 If I am going to use usage instead of pretty means it will print in console in the way of key nd value format like json format.
